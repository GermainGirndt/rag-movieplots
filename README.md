## Automated Prompt Engineering
Programmatically add context info on lesser known movies to the LLM prompt. 

This can improve the answer considerably:
```
Question: Tell me about the movie "A Touch of Zen".
LLaMa2_7b answers by hallucinating:
"A Touch of Zen" is a 2001 Taiwanese film directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien ...

Using RAG the LLaMa2_7b returns the right answer:
Here\'s what I know about the movie "A Touch of Zen":\n\n* It was released in 1971, directed by King Hu.\n* The plot follows a well-meaning but unambitious scholar and painter named Gu who lives in a remote mountain village in Ming China during the 14th century AD.\n* The story is largely seen through Gu\'s eyes, with a focus on his clumsiness and ineffectualness.
